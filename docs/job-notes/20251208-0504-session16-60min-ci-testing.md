# Session 16 - 60 Minute Continuous Work Session

**Date**: December 8, 2025  
**Start Time**: 05:04 UTC  
**End Time**: 06:04 UTC (target)  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Instructions

Work continuously for 60 minutes:
1. Check time with `date` every 10 minutes
2. Fetch issue #2 with GitHub MCP every 10 minutes
3. Use report_progress frequently (doesn't mean stop)
4. Update this job note continuously
5. Do NOT stop until 60 minutes pass or explicit stop command
6. Task: Complete CI, focus on E2E tests (CLI Controller → Router → Cardhost-mock)

## Issue #2 Key Requirements

**Components needed:**
- controller: Browser frontend (TypeScript, React, jsapdu over IP)
- cardhost: APDU responder (TypeScript, jsapdu over IP)
- router: Server connecting them (Java/Quarkus) ✅ Done in Session 14
- cardhost-monitor: Monitoring UI for cardhost

**Testing Requirements (Critical):**
- Use Vitest (mandatory)
- E2E: "CLI Controller → Router → Cardhost-mock"
- NOT just mock platform unit tests
- Comprehensive: unit, integration, E2E
- Many test cases: normal, edge cases, error cases
- No console.log in tests

**Current Issue:**
Tests are calling mock platform directly - NOT testing the full system flow through jsapdu-over-ip library.
